I have one year of industry experience as a software developer at Motate, Presidio, Toast, and Zoho. As a Software Developer Intern at Motate, I am building a serverless multilingual content platform using AWS Lambda, enabling seamless translations across multiple languages with automated scaling. I have also automated AWS environments using Terraform and GitHub Actions, and optimized DynamoDB schemas with secondary indexes to improve query speeds while maintaining SOLID-coded Lambdas. At Presidio, I designed and deployed serverless internal platforms on multi-cloud and built microservices-based solutions with AWS, Azure, and Node.js.

In addition, I bring one year of industry experience as a software developer, with proficiency in cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure, and DevOps tools including Docker and Kubernetes. I hold AWS Certified Solutions Architect and HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate credentials. My background also includes practical experience in serverless development with AWS Lambda and Terraform, and expertise in container orchestration.
